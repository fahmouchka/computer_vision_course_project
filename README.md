This repository contains code of the dashboard developed in the Computer Vision course project and it has two main functionalities:

1. <strong> Perform Exploratory Data Analysis:
</strong> By plotting the distribution of the labels within the dataset, and generating 4 random images from the dataset to get some insights on the quality and the state of the images.

3. <strong> Model deployment and Inference:</strong>
After training the model on the kaggle notebook, we have saved its weights in order to facilitate inference on new images. In this section we can upload any image and get the predicted emotion using our trained model.
